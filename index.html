	<b>ABOUT</b> - This particular web site is devoted primarily to the John Deere 
	precision replica lines. The Precision Classic lines are some of the most highly 
	detailed replicas of farm machinery ever produced. Listed on the main page you 
	will find a brief description of all the John Deere Precision Classic releases. 
	In the original Precision Classic line there are 25 numbered models in the 14 
	year production run which started in 1990. You will also find a few special 
	editions and variations. Throughout the years Ertl has also issued some other 
	precisions that were not necessarily part of the original product line. These 
	additional lines include a smaller 1/32 scale line referred to as the Series 
	II Precision Classic line, A Precision Classic Construction line of equipment, 
	a series of Precision Classic Lawn and Garden tractors and equipment, and a 
	new line of precisions introduced in late 2004 marketed as the Precision Key 
	series and finally in 2011 the Precision Elite Series. On the home page each 
	edition will list available inventory and retail pricing. Since these collectors 
	items are not toys you will find the prices may vary greatly depending on several 
	points. The age of the item, the rarity of the item, condition of the replica, 
	the completeness of the replica and the condition of the box. Therefore, inventory 
	may vary in price accordingly. Please keep in mind that the inventory may not 
	necessarily be new. Many items I may purchase second hand because of the length 
	of time that they have been discontinued. Each item is opened for inspection 
	(unless the package is factory sealed), its condition is carefully evaluated, 
	it is returned to its original packing and notations are made along with each 
	listing. <br><br><b>ORDERING</b> - An item can be ordered in any one of 3 different 
	ways. Order online by clicking the "Add To Cart" button and following the prompts. 
	Our online Credit Card processing is handled by PayPal. If you do not have an 
	account, the web site will automatically create one for you as you enter in 
	your payment and shipping information. If you wish to phone in your order, please 
	contact us at 636-221-2591 8:00 to 5:00 central time, Monday - Friday. If you 
	wish to mail your payment, please contact us first so that we may reserve your 
	item. Payments are required within one week for reserved items. <br><br>Please 
	understand that every effort is made to keep the website up-to-date. Although 
	it would be a rare occasion, it is possible that an item added to your cart 
	may already be sold. In the event that the item you purchased is already sold, 
	I reserve the right to send one of equal or greater value, or refund the full 
	purchase price with shipping. <br><br>We do not ship partial orders. If you 
	place an order for a item not currently in stock, the entire order will be held 
	until the order can be shipped complete. <br><br><b>RETURNS</b> - Generally 
	speaking returns are not accepted. The items we sell are accurately described 
	to the best of our ability. If a unit has never been opened, the buyer takes 
	full responsibility for the item at the time of purchase. www.precisionclassic.com 
	will not be held responsible for manufacturing defects or shortages on unopened 
	items. If the condition of an unopened item is a concern, we will open an unopened 
	box to check its condition and completeness. This will only be done by request 
	on a prepaid item. If you feel the item you received was not accurately described 
	please contact us at 636-221-2591 for a resolution. <br><br><b>SHIPPING</b> 
	- All items are carefully packaged to insure safe arrival. Typically each item 
	will be wrapped in plastic and then placed in an oversize box with a minimum 
	of two inches of shredded paper to cushion and protect the replica. All items 
	are shipped fully insured via FedEx unless another carrier is requested. Please 
	provide us with an physical address that will have someone available to sign 
	for the package. <br><br><b>INTERNATIONAL ORDERS</b> - The web site is not capable 
	of calculating shipping outside the main 48 US States. We encourage our customers 
	outside the 48 states to contact us for a shipping quote. <br><br><b>BUY,SELL,TRADE</b> 
	- Have a collection to sell? Have extras to barter with? Please contact us at 
	636-221-2591
